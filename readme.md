# MyFirstMongoDB - This is my First MongoDB Database in which I tried to perform or imply the CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations using Mongoose (package of MongoDB), Node.js (server-side Javascript environment), Postman (API Platform) and VsCode (IDE).

Operations:
1. In this Database a user can Sign-Up using his/her First-Name, Last-Name, Title, Email and Password, Email is a unique key in this i.e it can't have multiple entries with the same Email.
2. A user can Sign-In/Log-In using the same credentials that is used for the Sign-up purpose and can access or view their data.
3. A user can Update or manipulate his/her data with the help of the Unique key (Email), all the data except Email can be Updated or changed like First-name, Last-name, Title and Password.
4. A user can Deativate or Activate his/her account as per the choice, however by deactivating the account the data won't be deleted from the database but only be shown as inactive and won't be visible to the user.
5. A user can delete his/her account permanently from the database and this would lead the permanent deletion of the information which would be non recoverable.

I'll try to further enhance the code and add more operation with the time that would make it more effcient and more user-friendly. 
This code is for the purpose of practice and education only.
Thanks Cheers!
